# Changelog

0.4.5 
DEBUGGING: Ammended test options to run cpu model on GPU
Added the registration step to output

0.4.3 (2025-05-29) NJB
- Replaced gpu checkpoint in case it was not updated correctly in the last version

0.4.2 (2025-05-27) NJB LB
- Update to catch name (where checkpoint is stored)


0.4.1 (2025-05-22) NJB

- Updated to use the latest version of the model (n=215)

0.3.1 (2025-03-24) NJB
- Added in catch for age if outside of trained model range
- Added in loging for each session to return

0.3.0 (2025-03-21) NJB
Working version of the gear that can run at project level.
- catches input labels with dashes and underscores that are not in the BIDS standard
- Need to clean up code and document so is clearer
- Could shift elements of run.py to a separate file to make it cleaner
- Should set up catch for age? as model will run if older that the trained model but will not be accurate
- Log output is not comming out in expected order, need to check this
- Load in specific files for the model, rather than the whole directory

0.2.4 (2025-03-21) NJB
- Refactoring to run at the project level


0.1.8 (2025-03-12) NJB  
- Updated bottleneck_5 in residual_transformers3D.py  
- Refactored input for ants  


12/3/2025  
Version 0.1.6 NJB  
- update netG and model selection based on cpu/gpu selection

6/3/2025
Updated outfile naming to be cleaner in BIDs format


26/02/2025

Version 0.0.5 NJB
- Successfully tested on Flywheel

To Do:
clean output filename

Version 0.0.2 NJB
- refactoring the parser code

To Do:
** base_options needs to be updated to handle gpu selection rather than cpu default
** need to rebuild base image to handle GPU selection
** To run on GPU should batch process to save costs of loading Docker container each time


20/02/2025
Version 0.0.2 NJB, LB
- updates to run on CPU
- Not pushed to FW, need to rebuild from CUDA Docker image to ensure compatibility to run on GPU
- Current default is to run on CPU, need to check option to run on GPU
    This is currently set as condition if CUDA is available, then run on GPU, else run on CPU

14/02/2025
Version 0.0.1

Refactoring for Flywheel gear
